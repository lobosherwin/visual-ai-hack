# IronSight: Weapon Detection Using Computer Vision

## Introduction
IronSight is a computer vision-based weapon detection system designed to enhance public safety in high-risk environments such as airports, schools, and malls. By leveraging **YOLOv7** for object detection, IronSight aims to proactively identify threats and facilitate timely intervention.

## Project Mission
The primary goal of this project is to develop a **real-time, accurate, and scalable** weapon detection system that can assist in mitigating security risks before they escalate.

## Data Source
- **Dataset**: DaSCI dataset, containing annotated images classified into two categories: guns and human objects.
- **Size**: <1GB, making it lightweight and efficient for processing.
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to **500 pixels** for faster model inference.

## Model Training
- **Framework**: Python-based **YOLOv7** (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection model.
- **Approach**:
  - Image annotation with bounding boxes.
  - Confidence threshold tuning for accuracy.
  - Iterative testing to refine detection capabilities.

## Testing & Performance Evaluation
- The model is validated using multiple testing approaches.
- Performance metrics include **precision, recall, and confidence levels**.
- Edge cases are handled through data augmentation and model fine-tuning.

## Deployment
- The project is **open-source** and available on GitHub for further enhancement.
- Potential applications include **academic research, law enforcement, and public surveillance systems**.

## Deliverable
- **Final Output**: An efficient weapon detection model that visually identifies firearms in public spaces.
- The system utilizes a **pre-trained Haar Cascade Object Detection Model** for additional verification.
- **Visualization**: The detected weapon is highlighted with bounding boxes in real-time.
